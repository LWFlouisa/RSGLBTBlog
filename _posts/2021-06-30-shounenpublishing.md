For those who dont know, what determines whether something is a Shounen or Seinin manga is based on the magazine it is published in. In the past, this has caused issues like what should be Seinin manga is technically shounen.

For me as a creator, if I go the Manga route, where I take issue is I consider my work a Seinin and Josie hybrid. Then throw in the more subtle issues revolving around Manga censorship that is more subtle than than the CCA.

This is why Im considering publishing "strip novels", a distinction from graphic novels only relevant in the US, as doujinshi rather than in a magazine as self contained 80-120 page oblong text comics.

Ill be using the term Emirotamo to label my work, derived from Mortamour.
