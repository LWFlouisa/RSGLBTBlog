Independant Comix is not a right wing movement. It most certainly not a statist or Marxist Leninist movement. Comicsgate people will make it look like the only platform for independant comix is the hashtag comicsgate. 

This is despite the history of comix coming about as a reaction against things like the Comic Code Authority. Image comics was a right wing offshoot of independant comics, sort of like the difference between Free Software and Open Source. 

In fact a lot of the difference between independant comix and self publishers is similar to the licensing differences between GNU schema and Creative-Commons. 

But you would never get this from Corporate Comix or Comicsgate, who want to monopolize the conversation around indie comics. 

Leftist Indie Comics is about fighting for more representation, and alternative distribution solutions. Learning how to be your own boss. I had looked forward to introducing people to creative commons, peertube, and other alternatives to the social media giants as a different form of self promotion. 

Indie comix extends creators rights to produce what they want, not roll them back.
