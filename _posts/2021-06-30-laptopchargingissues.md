Currently I seem to be having issues charging my laptop. Mainly this means that my newest Asus laptop cant seem to charge beyond 98 percent. I might consider doing a new OS install of Linux Mint to Linux Mint 20. Although I never encountered this issue on any of my older machines.

I would use the most current laptop, but I seem to be having a chattery keyboard issue with the built in keyboard. Mentioned tomom that I need a new laptop, but she seems to be trying to delay that as long as possible.

But in the mean time, laptop time may be limited, which will effect mainly how I can publish my webcomic on Manga-No. This wonteffect the Comic Fury version.
