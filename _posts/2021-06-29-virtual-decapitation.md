Along the river bend flowing,<br />
her wooden shoes<br />
flows along the ripples.<br />
Flowing along her wooden shoes<br />
water breaks.

Up the scaffold, a thief may<br />
go, up whicker stairs.<br />
Up the whicker stairs<br />
with hair all flowing down the<br />
whicker stairs.

The falling ax falls down on the necks<br />
of petty thieves.<br />
All petty thieves<br />
lose their heads, tumbling<br />
into baskets.

So it is the dream of the<br />
thief and the toads<br />
that one may lose<br />
the only things that binds one<br />
to all life.
