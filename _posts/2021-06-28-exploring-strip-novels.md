The main difference between a comic book, and a graphic novel, is that a graphic novel is generally meant as a self-contained book of at least 80 pages of narrative. This ultimately disqualifies serial fiction, and comic strips. However I plan on taking graphic novels in a slightly different direction.

For the purposes of this blog post, the main difference between a comic strip and a “strip novel”, is that a strip novel is formatted similarly to a comic strip, however rather than each strip of content being a self-contained gag or tragedy, each episode is part of a lengthy but ultimately limited narrative where where each previous episode directly has an impact on what happens on the next episode.

This means that each chapter is composed of 13-15 pages with 1-4 panels each, that build toward a specific thematic finish. You would then collect 7-10 chapters into a self-contained rectangular formatted book in hard back. These would have more mature narratives of a decisively political nature.

In a sense, a strip novel is as different from a newspaper strip, as the graphic novel is to the funny books. There is a lot more a strip novel has in common with graphic novels, than comic strips.

Emirotamo, in the way that I specifically envision them, with their themes of exploring death in a way to celebrate life, would be a ( for now ) fictional example of a “strip novel”.
