title: Established Creators Should Not Participate In Manga Competitions

I respect the manga industries tendency to try to welcome not creators and talent into it, unlike what has been happening in American comics for some time now. However there is a major issue I think is worth not ignoring.

Recently I started looking into different manga competitions online, including a personal favorite Silent Manga Audition, which generally does not suffer from these issues. However several other initiatives that claim to support rising talent also have it. What I'm specifically referring to is the tendency for manga competitions to not care who is submitting work, as long as its a winning entry.

This leads to a tendency to overwhelmingly prefer native talent rather than new talent, who have more years of experience under their belt, and therefore able to tune their entry to the taste of the Japanese language reading audience. For example, imagine if in the sea of submissions, allowed to submit also included Akira Toriyama or Lynn Okamoto.

Obviously this means that if I were to submit to a competition today, then I would not be able to compete because I'm having to outshine an established professional who has been at this industry for decades. As good as Manga-No is, it suffers from a lot of these issues: as there is no curation as to find out whether someone is already working at Shounen Jump or not, so an established creator easily outshines any beginning creator just now learning out to produce manga.

It's not quite as bad as the nepotism ( which Comicsgate is actually not really against by the way ) found in American comics. But it's completely frusterating for people that want to compete at a level playing field.

This is one the one competition I submitted to will be my last one, and I think I'll be pursuing a fusion of BD and Manga in my own publishing venture, rather than try to make it in the mainstream comics world.
