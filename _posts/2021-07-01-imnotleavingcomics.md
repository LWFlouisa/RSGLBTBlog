I’m not leaving the comics business. However I’m perfectly fine with having certain people believe this, if that means that I’ll be off their radar pursuing the publishing path I want to do. What I am however doing, is rethinking my publishing strategy overseas. The typical route is to attract the attention of one of Shuesha’s editor, and then serialize in a magazine.

However my long term plan is actually to introduce Western graphic novels, or more specifically “Strip Novels” in the American Indie Market, to the Japanese marketplace. This will be something of a fusion of BDs and Manga. The panel layout will be similar to four koma, but with some differences. Sometimes pages will fluctuate between one panel per page to four panels per page.

This more closely resembles the nine panel transition, which is something of a misnomer because each panel may have less than nine panels, but each page performs on a nine panel grid. For my strip novels, each of these will behave on a four panel grid, even if individual pages may sometimes have less than four frames.

If I’m being accurate, I will be introducing American comic strips to the Manga market, by route of an adult variation of comic strips, designed to have the pacing on comic strips, but act as one continuous by limited narrative up to around eighty to one hundred and twenty pages. These will not be split into multiple strips, but published as a collection of strips. These will be bound with traditional Japanese binding and decorated book covers, rather than ones specifically for manga.

It will only be when opened, that the reader will see that, other than being read top to down, and right to left, rather than a “manga”, it will feature relationship between love and death. I call these “Death Strips” or strip novels.
