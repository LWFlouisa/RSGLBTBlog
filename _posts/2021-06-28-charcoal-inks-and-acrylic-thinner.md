### BASE RECIPE

2 3/4 cup of charcoal soot<br />
2 tsp of honey or gum arabic<br />
2 whole cups vinegar<br />
1 air tight jar<br />

You can use any kind of charcoal, though I prefer the soot of cedar. Let ferment in mixture from one week to a month, or until all the soot ( ground into a powder ) has been completely dissolved.

After this has been allowed to ferment, cold strain the fluid, and then add one iron supplement to the goop. Continually strain and add the charcoal paste until all the solids are paste-like. The longer you ferment, the darker it gets.

Note that this never gets as dark as India Ink. Now use this instead of water, when grinding an ink stick in a calligraphy set. Grind this as long as you normally would. This will give your ink a burnt wood like visual consistency. But you can also use it to thin out acrylic ink.

### COLORIZATION

Colored acrylic ink<br />
Charcoal paste and vinegar<br />
miniature jam jar<br />

The vinegar will thin out the acrylic ink until it has a water color like consistency. Sometimes I also add instant coffee, when using red, in order to simulate a blood like appearance. I keep a 28oz can of red acrylic screen printing ink to make new water color.
