The people actually ruining the discussion around comics is not SJWs. Most of the time actual SJWs dont even actually talk about comics. The people that are currently discussing them, are groups like Comicsgate, who understand as much about comics as a caveman understand a pocket watch.

How did we fucking get here? Clearly if it were all just what happened to Heather Antos, then they would not even be touching other issues on the periphery. And youll notice none of them ever talk about what actually matters in comics: the art and craft of comics. The scriptwriting, penciling, inking, coloring, lettering. The list goes on.

I also have to intentionally not put in a comments section, in order to prevent harassment of myself and others. Clearly the discussion around comics is a clusterfuck, but treating everyone you percieve as male, and acting like a TERF is not helping the issues. Marvel and DC has plenty of opprotunities to not en encourage transphobia by people whom would otherwise be victims of these hate groups.

It undermines the credibility of the entire narrative. And there is a part of me that wonders if what is actually going on matches the reality Im being spoonfed on twitter.

We need to return to talking about what is actually important in comics, and the latest outrage that some SJW or Anti SJW does is not one of these. And there are tens of other publishers to discuss the content of than Marvel or DC.

And yet every time I tune in on youtube, all these dipshits have to talk about is what latest controversy Marvel of DC is doing. Or spamming indiegogo, a platform for hate. And then act like a deer in the headlights when I refuse to use crowdfunding platforms in anyway, especially now that CG types are hijacking kickstarter again.

There are literally thousands of ways to produce and distribute comics. And none of these have to revolve around crowdfunding.

Rather than blaming people for reading manga, keep your own house in order first. It is not manga perpetuating the comicsgate phenominon.
