Kaching kaching bling,<br />
Lets keep churning the outrage machine,<br />
Give me straight, give it to be whole.<br />
Give it all to me during the superbowl.

Kaching kaching bling,<br />
Give me all the outrage,<br />
So I can die at age sixty,<br />
Getting all the bad coffins.<br />
Like its all the rage.
