I have a specific dream studio in mind. Generally when I draw sketches and ink, I’ll sit in the sun room to do my initial drafting, and then do the ink brushing of my pages in the bathroom remade into an art studio. This isn’t me choice, but it works for the purpose for now.

But my dream studio would be a where I would have my bookshop in the same room I keep my studio, with it efficiently arranged sort of like how one efficiently stores stuff inside of a tiny house: I would store the studio equipment in the upper right corner, with store activities going on downstairs, where there would be magazine racks and trade paperback shelves.

There would also be a living room with a television, to test play visual novels. The room aesthetic would be similar to Strasbourg, Alsace. And the decorations modeled after the brother’s grim. There would be inmoov robots greeting customers, modeled in a similar manner in which I would dress Porcelain dolls, like red riding hood with wooden shoes. I would probably keep miniature guillotine to cut cigars with on the landing.

But the best part is the vicinity to a family food store, where you can purchase meat and veggies for less than a dollar, and single packs of bacon for around ten cents. I love Vietnamese and Korean grocery stores, although I’m not sure they would sell cheap bacon. But I love their red bean paste and other things like dehydrated mushrooms, and different sauces.

My bedroom would probably be similar in design to a cross between a traditional room from Alsace, and one in feudal Japan.
