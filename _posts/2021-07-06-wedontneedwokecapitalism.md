There is a lot of positive progress being made in social justice, minus the bullshit spread by twitter about trans issues by non trans people. However I noticed a thing about the comics industry that desperately needs to change.

I was reading an article on Bleeding Cool how Amy Cooper became famous for filing a false testimony against a black man. What I found more disturbing though is DC trying to cash in on the event, and signed a deal simply because he became famous for it

We need positive social justice, but that means not letting corporations hijack wokeness and turn it into a money making enterprise.

Woke Capitalism is the exact opposite economic direction that I need to go. But if I said this publicly on Twitter, Id get lumped with people that dont share my political values.

The industry would rather lump those on the far left with the right, than face actual accountability for things like only offering book contracts to celebrities. Rather than actual minorities that face real descrimination

We need to listen to actual minorities voices, and stop offering book contracts to the Johnny Depps or John Greens of the world.
