Before I introduce different kinds of BD and Manga reviews, it’s worth noting that eventually I’m going to be phasing out English as the primary language in which I produce sequential art. Most likely I will either do French or Japanese language comics until I properly flesh out my constructed language, which is a Fraponic Language, this is one that is derived from French, but borrows are considerable amount of Japanese vocabulary.

The original intent behind the language was to explore an alternative future, where Japan controls the Eastern half of the United States, and France controls the Western half. However currently there are factors that exploring a sequential art form in this future impractical: this would mean the Eastern US would follow the manga production route, while the US would follow the BD route.

My goal with the constructed language, and its resulting culture, to standardize the form and format of Hafestra. Although later I may organically make Hafestra the mother tongue, and have different derivative languages based on the different dialects of what was once the United States.

English will still be used in comics set in the pre-invasion period when neither France or Japan controlled parts of the United States. My blog will also be primarily written in my mother language of English.
