To me, most of what seems to get labelled as attractive by reactionaries, is completely the opposite of what I find attractive.

In general to me a cute character design should be a vehicle for attractive outfits and shoes. It happens I have a very different standard of cute outfits and shoes.

What I dont get, in manga youll frequently find crocs. But not Birkenstocks. But you will find them in some western graphic novels. And for those who dont know, wooden shoes and birkenstocks, for now, is the only shoes I know how to draw.

But characters whose chests are so big it breaks their necks and backs is fucking ridiculous. Im genuinely not sure why Reactionaries find their designs attractive.
