What seems to be becoming increasingly apparent, a lot of the people on Twitter dont actually really care about victims of comicsgate, and more about fluctuating their tremendous egos. Rather than listen to actual victims, they would rather act like theyre the only voice of those harassed by them. None of this is ever actually said. Rather its demonstrated by theor unwillingness to share information. What this has effectively done is I will neither financially support comicagate people, or those that claim to support victims of comicsgate on twitter.

It is also apparent that people on twitter seem to use the term comicsgate like how dipshits is the term "it" in games. This is completely disrespectful to actual victims.

What I already had in mind was to focus on producing manga, rather than American comics, as this is the kind of content I have always read. I had a slight derailment by the hate group comicsgate, but nothing I cant recover from. I do need to get into the routine of muting people affiliated with American comics however.

Note that Shintoaigazo, or Emirotamo, applies to the manga industry and not American comics, which is basically dead to me at this point.

Most likely Im going to market and promote these as strip novels in the US.
