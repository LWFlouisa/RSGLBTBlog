Im strongly considering maintaining a private twitter profile, if I do decide to continue using it. Mainly its starting to suck away a lot of writing time. And a lot of my time is already being sucked away by arting my graphic novel.

I finally had to mute a crap ton of the writing community on twitter, as people will either give you dickish unsolicited advice simply for saying your a writer, or spam you with Amazon links. Although the latter is not as much of a problem anymore.

Im presently redrawing my graphic novel, but you can find a prototype version at itch:
