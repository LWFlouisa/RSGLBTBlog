Emirotamo is a Hafestran word loaned from French, spelled as Mortamour. It references a kind of graphic novel that revolves around the romantic depiction of death. Although it has taken on a connatation of being lower case than other kinds of horror comics.

In format, emirotamo is published in Oblong Books, featuring a reading order of top to down, and right to left. These generally operate on a 4 panel transition. A hybrid between a comic strip and a graphic novel.

Emirotamo is Shintoaigazo without the anarchist overtones of Shintoaigazo. Although there is still a significant amount of anarchist influence if you know where to look.

As I move into writing exclusively in my conlang, the format of this will manifest itself.
