### Initial Frusteration
I had written an essay in the past on my frusteration with Square Soft, and how it took at total of 10 years to actually come out with a remake. All the way I had largely forgotten about the game.

The entire purpose of the trailer functioned solely for the purpose of generating hype for future Final Fantasies, from FF12 onwards.

### Comicsgate, And How They Misinterpret Independant Comics
So you might think I would agree that delayed releases are had. However the problem is its actually Comicsgate that grifts an insane amount of hype, but most dont really have anything tangible from crowd funding campaigns.

But to me both the way Comicsgate promises big and delivers none, and symptomatic of the same issue of people using elements of nerd culture purely for the purposes of generating hype, while not actually delivering anything for the customer in question.

Addotionally, these people seem incapable of concieving of the difference between someone producing a passion project on their own, and someone create goods for a corporation. Yet are quick to blame people whose sole output is based on producing comics for their own entertainment.

If your hype framework is based on unfullfilled promises and undelivered results, your hype machine is abusive. You should only advertise precisely what you know you can deliver to customers, or focus purely on passion projects. In which case why be a gas guzzling planet destroying corporation?

### Game Series Not Effected By Abusive Hype Mechanics
At least for now Grandia has not given into the same false promise delivering framework of Square Soft. Or the abusive power dynamics of comicsgate. But they still waste resources on something like Grandia online than an official new title to the series.

### We Need Indies, But Shove Profits Up Your Ass
This is why we need indies, to embrace both independant creative spirit, but also embrace passion projects.
