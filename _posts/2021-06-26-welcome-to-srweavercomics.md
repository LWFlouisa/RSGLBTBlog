My goal is to introduce the world to different kinds of comics outside of the American comic industry. My primary focus will revolve around Franco-Belgian BDs, and Manga. But everyone now and then I will blog about Manwha, Manhua, Viet Comics, Thai Comics, and other kinds of Asian comics. As well as some other South Western European comics like Spanish, Portuguese, and possibly Italian. I'm also developing an interest in Oblong Books, that originate in Holland.

I will also have posts about Ink Making, picking the right brush ( it depends on the ink type ), and how to layout my own form of Graphic Novel, that is derived from a fusion of 4-Koma format ( Manga ) and Oblong printed books ( European Comics ).
